 * A local fixture, for running the CRM before Supabase exists.

 * `data/clients.local.json` is gitignored. It holds real client rows, so it
 * belongs on her machine and in Supabase — never in the repository. The file
 * is optional: without it the Clients zone says it is not connected, which is
 * the honest state.
 *
 * Read once per process. This is a dev convenience, not a cache layer.
